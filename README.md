## My project

I believe I have ability to extend my project, but now my credit (from aws gateway) is very high, I am afraid I have no enough credit to learn more for next projects, so I temporarily stop this project now. Hope my results meet the specifications of this project.

## My Lambda functions

I have a file **lambda.py** contains my 3 lambda functions as the requirement of the project and a directory **lambda_functions** that  contains my three seperate lambda functions with <em>test event json file"</em>.  

## My suggestion

When I build the 2nd Lambda function, I have a serious problem with the instruction in the notebook **"Because this Lambda will have runtime dependencies (i.e. the SageMaker SDK) you'll need to package them in your function. Key reading: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package-create.html#python-package-create-with-dependency"**. When I posted my question to get help from Mentor, my model and my endpoint lasted overnight, then my aws credit increased too high (my fault). I think the instructions need change to **[sagemaker runtime endpoint guide](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/call-an-amazon-sagemaker-model-endpoint-using-amazon-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda/)** (as our mentors help me) in order that the students have more exact instructions.

# 2. Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!

I will learn more to create new results according to the <em>"Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!"</em> by my own credit from "Free tier".

# 3. Thank you - all Udacity members - so much for all your helpful supports.

When I submitted the project, AWS gateway removed all my old work and set my cost as $0 - I don't know this process. I ran all the code on Sagemaker in order to create new endpoint that help me get the new image of the execution of my stepfunction. 

New images of visualization are created on my local because the captured data has been downloaded into my local machine.
